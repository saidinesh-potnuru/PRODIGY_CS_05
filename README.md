TASK : Network Packet Analyzer
      "Develop a packet sniffer tool that captures and analyzes network packets. Display relevant information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and payload data. Ensure the ethical use of the tool for educational purposes".

Network Packet Analyzer :

Overview :
This project is a packet sniffer tool designed to capture and analyze network packets. It displays relevant information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and payload data for educational purposes. Ethical considerations and responsible use are emphasized in the development and deployment of this tool.

Features :

  *Packet Capture: Capture network packets from a specified interface or network.
  *Packet Analysis: Display detailed information about each captured packet, including headers and payload.
  *Protocol Support: Analyze packets for various protocols such as TCP, UDP, HTTP, etc.
  *Educational Use: Intended for learning and understanding network protocols and packet structure.

Usage:

  1. Run the packet analyzer tool on a system with network access.
  2. Select the network interface or specify a network to monitor.
  3. View captured packets and analyze relevant information.
  4. Gain insights into network communication and protocol behavior.

Ethical Considerations:

  *Responsible Use: Use this tool in compliance with legal and ethical guidelines.
  *Privacy: Avoid capturing sensitive information or data not intended for monitoring.
  *Educational Purpose: Use for educational or research purposes to enhance understanding of network protocols.

Security Note:
